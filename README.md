**🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard**
**Power BI | Excel | SQL**

A comprehensive COVID-19 data analysis project that uses Excel for cleaning, SQL for data processing, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.
This project helps visualize the spread, impact, and trends of COVID-19 using real-world datasets.

**📌 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 global and regional data to understand how cases, recoveries, and deaths evolved over time.
The dashboard allows users to interactively explore patterns and compare statistics across different countries and time periods.

**🎯 Objectives****

Perform data cleaning and preparation using Excel

Use SQL to transform, aggregate, and filter the dataset

Build a data model in Power BI

Visualize global COVID-19 trends with interactive charts

Help stakeholders understand the pandemic’s impact

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Power BI Desktop – dashboard and data modeling

Excel – initial data cleaning

SQL – queries for transformation and preprocessing

DAX – measures for KPIs and time-series calculations

**📁 Dataset Used**

The dataset includes:

Date-wise COVID-19 cases

Confirmed, recovered, and deceased counts

Country & region information

Population data (optional)

(You can replace these with your own dataset names later.)

**🗃️ Data Pipeline**
**1️⃣ Excel – Data Cleaning**

Removed duplicates

Fixed missing or inconsistent values

Standardized date formats

Merged multiple sheets/files

**2️⃣ SQL – Data Processing**

Created tables for cases, countries, and daily updates

Joined datasets

Aggregated daily and monthly statistics

Used SQL queries to prepare data for Power BI

**3️⃣ Power BI – Visualization & Insights**

Connected processed tables

Built a star-schema model

Created DAX measures for:

Total Confirmed Cases

Total Recovered

Total Deaths

Active Cases

Daily & Monthly Trends

**📊 Dashboard Features**

KPI Cards: Total Cases, Recoveries, Deaths, Active Cases

Trend Line Charts: Daily & monthly case progression

Country Comparison Table

Map Visualization showing global spread

Slicers for:

Country

Month

Case Type (Confirmed/Recovered/Deaths)

Drill-down views for continent → country → date

**⭐ Key Insights**

Identification of peak months with highest case spikes
Countries with the highest confirmed cases and fatalities
Growth/decline trends over time
Comparison between global regions
Recovery rate and death rate analysis
